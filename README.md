## Game Introduction
Tic-tac-toe (also known as noughts and crosses or Xs and Os) is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. 
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
